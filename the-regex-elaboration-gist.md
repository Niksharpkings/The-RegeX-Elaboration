## Summary

> ### Regex is a powerful regular math -> English language finite automation[^1], which can be also referred as Stephen Cole Kleene's theorem[^2], used to sequentially characterized specific search patterns of text/symbols/documents by using a string-search algorithm[^3], also known as "find" or "find and replace" strings/input validation technique that is developed in theoretical computer science[^4] and formal language theory[^5]. 
Regex was popular in Unix text-processing utilities in the 1980 and has now become textualized pattern and match-making sequentialized processing behemoth.
It is widely used in Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, web application and widely known and frequently used search engines and platforms.

#### The following can be used to validate a matching search result of an email 
```regex
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
```
